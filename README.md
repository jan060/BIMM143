# Introduction to Bioinformatics (BIMM143)
This is my Bioinformatics Lab FA19 portfolio at [UCSD](https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_F19/). Throughout the course we've explored genomic and proteomic databases, performed data analysis and visualization in R, and interpreted high throughput data sets in biological networks and cancer genomics.
